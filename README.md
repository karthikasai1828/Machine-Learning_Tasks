# Mall Customer Segmentation Project




## Overview
Customer segmentation is a crucial aspect of marketing strategy, allowing businesses to identify distinct groups of customers with similar characteristics and behaviors. This project aims to perform customer segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm on a dataset obtained from Kaggle. By analyzing customer data such as age, gender, annual income, and spending score, we will uncover meaningful segments that can inform targeted marketing efforts.

## Introduction
Customer segmentation involves dividing a customer base into groups or segments based on shared characteristics. This segmentation enables businesses to personalize their marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and drive sales. In this project, we leverage the K-means clustering algorithm to identify distinct customer segments using data collected from a mall.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains information on 200 customers. The dataset includes the following features:

CustomerID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Gender: Gender of the customer.
Age: Age of the customer.
Annual Income (k$): Annual income of the customer.
Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending habits.
You can access the dataset on Kaggle here.

You can access the dataset on [Kaggle](/kaggle/input/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python/Mall_Customers.csv).


## Methodology
We employ the K-means clustering algorithm to perform customer segmentation. This algorithm partitions the dataset into a predetermined number of clusters, with each cluster represented by its centroid. By iteratively assigning data points to the nearest centroid and updating centroids, K-means identifies distinct customer segments based on their characteristics.


## Results
The results of the customer segmentation analysis will be presented, showcasing the identified segments and their respective characteristics. Visualization techniques such as scatter plots or cluster profiles may be used to illustrate the findings.
